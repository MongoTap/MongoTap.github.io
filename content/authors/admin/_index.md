I am Yanlong Huang, currently in my second year of pursuing a master's degree with a keen interest in financial technology (FinTech) and natural language processing. In my first year, I had the privilege of presenting a paper in the Student Abstract track at AAAI 2023, and I currently have a paper under review for the Information Systems Research journal. Additionally, I am gearing up to submit a paper about FinTech to ACL 2024.

My academic journey has been recognized with the Graduate Freshman Scholarship in 2022 and further accolades in 2023, including the Academic Master's Degree First-Class Scholarship and the Tencent Corporate Scholarship. Alongside these achievements, I have actively participated in some AI competitions in China for two consecutive years, securing notable rankings such as second and third place. This multifaceted experience underscores my dedication to scholarly pursuits and the dynamic intersection of technology and artificial intelligence.
